# Here is a schema builder of my first project

So, I configured:
- Standard objects like Accounts (for venues and fans)
- Campaigns (for tours)
- Custom objects (Songs, Albums, Artists, Track Lists, Performs On)
- Mastered complex relationships 😭:
- Many-to-many junctions for setlists (Track List linking Tours to Songs)
- Collaborations (Performs On linking Artists to Songs)
- Lookups from Songs to Albums
- Dynamic field visibility on Accounts for venue-specific details
- A custom Lightning Console App to tie everything together

Key Learnings:
- Deepened my expertise in data modeling: choosing master-detail vs. lookup relationships, building scalable many-to-many relationships, and optimizing for reporting and user experience.
- Gained hands-on experience with Dynamic Forms, Schema Builder, and Lightning App Builder.
- Learned best practices for clean, efficient org design that balances flexibility and performance.
- This superbadge reinforced how powerful Salesforce is for industry-specific solutions especially in the music and entertainment sector.

Think unified fan/venue/tour data for personalized experiences, streamlined tour planning, artist collaborations, and real-time insights similar to how companies like Live Nation or streaming services use Salesforce for ticketing, marketing, and fan engagement.

I’m excited to apply these skills in future projects: custom CRMs for record labels, event management for festivals, or fan loyalty platforms for artists. The possibilities to rock the music industry with Salesforce are endless! 🎸
